When a switch receives a frame the source MAC address is added to the table if it does not already have an entry for that MAC address. If the destination is unknown, the frame is flooded out all interfaces for that VLAN other than the one it was received on.

        There are two hints to discover the original subnet set that this was created from. First, it is explicitly said it is a class B, which is of size /16. Second, no explicit original network is provided. The only safe conclusion that can be made is that the original network is a /16. Since you have two bits to work with, the difference between the original and given networks, 4 subnets are available to use.

        The network mask is 255.255.248.0, which means there are 11 bits used for the host portion, 3 of which are in the third octet. You can safely ignore the fourth octet for this exercise as all bits will be on in that octet for broadcast. The third octet uses three bits, which means we work in multiples of 8 for this as three bits provide 8 permutations. Quick math tells us that 96 is the closest multiple of 8 that is not larger than 100. The next value is 104, or 172.19.104.0. Subtract 1 to get 172.19.103.255.

By configuring the preferred transport to "none" that specific behavior is disabled without breaking DNS.

        The CIDR notion indicates a mask using 30 network bits and 2 host bits. The 2 host bits give 4 permutations, so to solve work in multiples of 4 for each network. 24 is an easy number to start with as it is evenly divisible by 4, meaning it is the network ID or first IP in the subnet. Add 3 (.4 is 1, so there are 3 more IPs) to get 27 or 192.168.100.27 for the broadcast address.

        The CIDR notion indicates a mask using 20 network bits and 12 host bits. The 20th bit is part of the third octet, making that the interesting octet to work with and meaning we can take a shortcut by ignoring the other octets. The 20th bit means there are 4 bits for host bits within the third octet, 4 bits provides 16 permutations so we work in multiples of 16 and some quick math shows that 224 is the largest multiple of 16 without going over 225. The question asks for the network ID so all host bits are set to 0, which gives us 224.0 for the last two octets, or 65.167.224.0 for our network ID.

        The question asks for a network of at least size 23 without being wasteful. Translate that to there should be some value of host bits that equal at least 23 with waste of 23 or less. Using 4 bits is only 16 permutations so that is too small. Using 5 host bits provides 32 permutations, wasting 9 IPs. The next size up would be more wasteful, so use the mask that uses 5 bits or 255.255.255.224.

        Of the available answers, ARP Probe is the best answer. While it is ARP, it is more specifically an extra ARP to determine whether a client is using that IP as relying on ARP only could lead to stale IPs remaining in the consumed pool due to needing to wait for the ARP table to age out. A Gratuitous ARP would be for if the interface changes IP and wants to inform other devices that it has a new IP.

        This is a subnetting exercise, with the goal to find the smallest sized network that both 10.0.2.45 and 10.0.9.254 fit within. Since the third octet is the first octet where things change, we can safely ignore any answer that uses the fourth octet as the interesting octet. Of the two remaining answers, 255.255.240.0 is a block size of 16 which when applied to the PC IP we start at 10.0.0.0 and run through 10.0.15.255. This allows the PC and gateway IPs to be within the same subnet without being wasteful since 255.255.224.0 is larger.

Since this asks for multiple vendors, CDP may not be a good choice unless all vendors involved support sending and receiving CDP. The question aslo asks for directly connected devices, and while ARP and the MAC table could show directly connected devices, you can't know from that table which are directly connected if any are at all.

        The question states that conversion has completed. After this is done, the root switch only consists of designated ports. Other downstream switches will use blocking, designated, and root ports. Learning isn't a port type, rather it is a port state.

        Trunk ports are used for extended VLANs across multiple switches, the use of tagging allows for traffic to remain part of a given VLAN. Access ports do not tag traffic except with the voice VLAN. Routed switchports do not typically use VLAN tagging, though a sub interface on a router would. Etherchannel is entirely unrelated to tagging, though often it is used with a trunk link.

        The primary and secondary root commands are actually macros that look at the current state of the environment and apply an STP value to the configuration that would cause them to be in the role they are configured for. This isn't a permanent configuration in that the switch will always be root regardless of the environment, so a new switch entering the environment with a lowered value could still become root if the value is low enough.

        The Etherchannel protocol that is Cisco proprietary is PAgP. Very few vendors will support this and for this reason LACP is typically done even in Cisco environments. Port-Channel is not a protocol, rather it is an interface name and LAG (Link Aggreggation) is a generic term for Etherchannel.

        The best command of these options is `show ip route 10.0.1.2`. While `show ip route` would work, it will be up to you to determine which interface it would use while the former option explicitly tells you. The `show ip arp 10.0.1.2` option would only provide an answer if there is an entry for it on the ARP table, and `show ip protocols` would not provide this answer.

        The most conservative statement will include as few other networks as possible. 192.168.0.0 with an wildcard mask of 0.0.3.255 includes 192.168.0.0 > 192.168.3.255, which is the smallest combination that will cover both interfaces. The wildcard mask of 0.0.0.255 is too small and the other two are too large.

        The INIT state is the only one where this scenario can be true, as the local router would have had to receive an OSPF Hello packet, though while in the INIT state the router may not know the router ID of the neighbor. EXSTART and LOADING are further in the process after the DR and BDR are elected so routers already know about one another and are communicating. ATTEMPT is only applicable for NBMA networks but in this state communication from the neighbor has not been received yet.

        The question specifically calls out that communicaitng with IP addresses fails, browsing the web fails, and that they cannot communicate with remote networks. The default route is required as a DHCP configuration in this scenario since the alternative is configuring more specific routes on host devices which is not scalable. It does not mention whether DNS works or not and that cannot be proven based on the information provided. If NTP were an issue, IP would still work but you may get certificate or other errors when browsing.

      explanation: >-
        Fa0/2 will need the IP helper configured. DHCP and DHCP relay work similarly, in that the interface listening for DHCP Discover messages must be able to receive those messages from client devices. Since DHCP Discover messages are broadcast, the interface the IP helper is configured on must be on the same broadcast domain as client devices. Knowing nothing about the network beyond that clients should be on the same side of the router as Fa0/2, we can pick Fa0/2 as the only reasonable answer.

        Configuring `logging trap 4` would set only warning or more severe messages to the syslog server. The numeric version is required for this command, so the English word equivilent would not work. A logging level 5 of would include notifications, which is more than we want.

      explanation: >-
        Ideally, latency and jitter should be low. Across the Internet or other very large networks a latency of 150ms and 30ms jitter should not be exceeded. Latency measures the time it takes for a packet to get from point A to B, while jitter measures the difference in latency between packets. A low jitter means that packets are arriving at regular latencies, which means conversation will sound more smooth and less choppy. Low latency allows a conversation to occur with little delay, which can be noticed when people on the phone talk over one another by mistake.

        Scheduling determines how packets are chosen to transmit on a congested link, with different criteria affecting how they're chosen for forwarding. Things like DSCP marking can affect this. Queuing is the act of placing a packet in the buffer to be scheduled, or transmitted. QoS is too general of a term, though it isn't necessarily wrong there are parts of QoS that are about ingress into the queue or dropping packets.

        The trust boundary describes where QoS values are administered and relevant to a given network. There is no specific place in a network that this is, rather it is a term to describe a logical area. Any devices or network(s) outside the trust boundary will likely not respect any QoS markings added within the boundary, and any markings made within the boundary are typically not respected either. A common example of one is an VoIP phone but sometimes the switchport is used instead.

        FIFO (First In First Out) acts on packets in the order they are received. True to its name, the first packet to arrive will be the first packet to egress the interface queue. WFQ (Weighted Fair Queuing) acts more intelligently, using values and multiple queues to help move packets along so the first packet received may not always egress first. CQ (Custom Queuing) uses multiple queues with variable queue limits and traffic classification to determine which packets are sent out. WRR (Weighted Round Robin) uses weights where the weight is proportional to the number of packets being sent, these are configurable by the administrator.

        RTP is the protocol used for transferring audio and video media data on real time calls and is important to prioritize and transfer efficiently on a network. SMB and TFTP are sensitive to latency, but they would not be prioritized, and EIGRP is not really sensitive to latency but it can be configured to account for latecny.

      explanation: >-
        Data traffic is typically not sensitive to delays. While the contents of data traffic changes between different networks or organizations, it is frequently bursty as it is only generated on an as needed basis and delivered using TCP. TCP accounts for loss, requiring retransmits if they are detected, and so long as they aren't excessive TCP will reliably get the data delivered.

        An SNMP Walk action is a series of successive GetNext requests to a host in order to query the full MIB tree of that host. GET would only return a single specified MIB value, SET would change a specific value, and TRAP is used for sending the status of a MIB value that can be alerted on to the NMS station.

        While SNMP is usually used to poll information from devices for monitoring purposes, you can also use an SNMP Set action to write values to a device for configuration as opposed to manually configuration. Get would return the value of a MIB, Inform messages are sent in response to Trap messages, and Response would be a message used to reply to a request from a manager such as a Get request.

        The DSCP value used for the actual voice stream in calls is 46. This traffic is usually RTP, which is different from SIP. SIP is usually DSCP 24, since it is not as essential to receive every SIP packet in a timely fashion as they only control signalling information such as call setup.

        When a device is configured to send SNMP Trap messages, it will proactively inform an NMS of certain behaviors that happen rather than waiting for a poll from the NMS. Get and Set messages are sourced from an NMS, so they would not be the end device immediately informing the NMS of an issue or change. An Inform is the response to a Trap.

        NBAR relies on hueristic information to identify traffic. Without that, of the available options, port number is one way to identify traffic as well known ports are freqently used for things like web traffic or email. This is becoming less reliable as time goes on as more services shift to using TLS on port 443, so a combination of things are needed such as related DNS traffic or the SNI (server name information) on a TLS setup, or other details are needed to identify traffic.

        Shaping is the QoS mechanism used on egress, allowing queuing and smoother transit of traffic around a given threshold. These are used opposite a policer (usually) to prevent the policer from dropping excess traffic and requiring retransmits or preventing a poor end user experience.

      explanation: >-
        When configuring an interface to use port security, the features or behavior of port security is configured independently from actually enabling it. Enabling port security is performed by entering `switchport port-security` on the interface. This can be helpful by allowing you to configure exactly what you want to do with port security prior to enabling it, preventing a client device from accidentally being kicked off the network.

      explanation: >-
        An access port is all that is needed for local mode APs, as all traffic will be sent to the WLC over the CAPWAP tunnel. While a trunk port would work, changing the native VLAN to something unused may actually break this since the AP will need its own traffic to reach the WLC. A routed port or Etherchannel solve different problems, not related to APs.
