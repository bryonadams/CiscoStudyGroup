Trivia questions created by the Cisco Study Group Discord community. https://discord.gg/jZffnuj

---

The Cisco Study Group Discord (as seen on https://reddit.com/r/ccna) provides a place for people pursuing Cisco certifications to collaborate in real time with others so that we can collectively work towards ~~shilling a vendor~~ learning more about networking. To that end, we provide a trivia bot that anyone can use to quiz themselves on topics.

Questions are formatted for use with RedBot https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot and are short answer format with potentially more than one correct answer. Some question types are not very valuable to have here, such as subnetting, since there are better resources to learn those (see https://subnettingpractice.com). Explanations for answers are not provided by the bot and interaction with the community is expected should the reader need one. If you wish to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request and I will review it.

The Cisco Study Group is in no form affiliated with Cisco and all questions within these lists are created by the community.

For questions or concerns about the bot or trivia content, please reach out to one of the moderators of the Cisco Study Group on Discord or submit an issue please.
